Title, author, etc. are stored as structured fields.

âœ… Content is stored as:

Rich HTML (if you're using a CMS or markdown parser)

Or Markdown (cleaner and dev-friendly)

ðŸ”¥ Pro Tip: Markdown is often stored and 
converted to HTML on the frontend using 
something like react-markdown.

const BlogDetail = ({ article }) => {
  switch (article.layout) {
    case 'tutorial':
      return <TutorialLayout content={article} />
    case 'news':
      return <NewsLayout content={article} />
    case 'case-study':
      return <CaseStudyLayout content={article} />
    default:
      return <DefaultLayout content={article} />
  }
}
